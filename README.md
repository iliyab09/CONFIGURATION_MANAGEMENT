Goals

Use Terraform to provision the infrastructure</br> from here ---> https://github.com/iliyab09/TerraformForAzure-IaC</br>
Use Ansible to deploy the NodeWeightTracker application</br>
Create two environments: Staging and Production</br>
Both environments must be identical except for the size of the vms (production ones must be larger)</br>
